# The `spe` package &mdash; species lite

A simple library for combinatorial species. For more information see the
[reference documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/spe)
on Hackage.

If you want something more substantial, then you will most likely be
happier with the
[`species` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/species)
by Brent Yorgey.
